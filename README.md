# Ionotronics Codebase

This repository contains the code base for the finite element implementation of the large deformation thermodynamically-consistent electro-chemo-mechanical theory I developed for ionic hydrogels used in ionotronic devices. 

Specifically, the repository contains all the relevant FEniCS codes and experimental data files for the large strain capacitive stretch sensor and large strain dynamic actuator studies presented in the paper.

I have also included a detailed .pdf document describing the major aspects of my approach to the numerical implementation of the theory in FEniCS.
