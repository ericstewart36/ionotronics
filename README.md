# Ionotronics Codebase

This repository contains the code base for the finite element implementation of the theory used in Chapter 3 of my M.S. thesis for the Mechanical Engineering department at MIT. This thesis is publicly available from the MIT libraries (https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/139556).

The repository contains all the relevant FEniCS codes and experimental data files for the large strain capacitive stretch sensor and large strain dynamic actuator studies presented in the paper.

I have also included a useful Excel spreadsheet of the material properties for the piezoelectric materials considered in my thesis work, and a .pdf writeup of how to create new analyses for the piezoelectricity UEL.
